# Input-Lag-Tweaks
Collection of every input lag tweak on the internet

YES ALOT IS TIN FOIL AND YES IT WILL BREAK SOME STUFF USE ONLY FOR HARDCORE GAMING WINDOWS INSTALL
For me really the only thing broken was the ability to click or interact with things on the taskbar.

READ THROUGH THE SCRIPTS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE RIGHT FOR YOU!!!

Everything here assumes you already have some basic knowledge etc and is what I consider to be everything important in one place MINUS Nvidia stuff as I can't cover it here however will be linked in additional reading.


---Additional Reading---

[Sweaty PC Optimisation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILugrwtHfmisYzI1MdCOhSzBPuLJPi5D7xYJgQ4sxDM/edit) Most Definately worth reading as it covers Nvidia stuff and what is not covered here.
